# fin_pred

## General
In this directory I will experiment with having neural networks predict vectors. The idea behind this is to predict time series data using neural networks. First, I want to try feed forward neural networks and later recurrent neural networks.

## Packages
'numpy'
'scikit-lean'
'theano'
'keras'
